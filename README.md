# Telegram-SFT-Bot

> I made a simple Telegram Bot to sign in and out for SFT on Google Sheets.
> This was made using Python and a few external libraries such as python-telegram-bot, sheets API (gspread).
> This bot is meant to be hosted on Heroku.
> I'm certain this bot can be improved a lot more. Maybe it can be made neater using inlinekeyboard?
> Feel free to clone it and improve it, I won't be improving it any more due to time constraints.
