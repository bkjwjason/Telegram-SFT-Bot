# Telegram-SFT-Bot

</details>


> I made a simple Telegram Bot to sign in and out for SFT on Google Sheets. Also it sends a reminder to sign out at the end of SFT Timings. Basically, a 'BIBO' book but digitalised.

> This was made using Python and a few external libraries such as python-telegram-bot, sheets API (gspread).
> 
> This bot is hosted on Heroku. I'm sure it can be improved further using an external DB like Mongo, unfortunately Heroku does not offer the option for free tier.
