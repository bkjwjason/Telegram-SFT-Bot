# Telegram-SFT-Bot

> I made a simple Telegram Bot to sign in and out for SFT on Google Sheets.
> This was made using Python and a few external libraries such as python-telegram-bot, sheets API (gspread).
> This bot is meant to be hosted on Heroku.
> I'm certain this bot can be improved a lot more. Maybe it can be made neater using inlinekeyboard?
> There are certain problems that could be improved too. Using an external databse like PostgreSQL or MongoDB? I'll have to look into that further, as I have no experience using those
