# Telegram-SFT-Bot

</details>


> I made a simple Telegram Bot to sign in and out for SFT on Google Sheets. Also it sends a reminder to sign out at the end of SFT Timings. Basically, a 'BIBO' book but digitalised.

> This was made using Python and a few external libraries such as python-telegram-bot, sheets API (gspread).
> 
> This bot is hosted on Heroku. I'm sure it can be improved further using a real external DB like Mongo, unfortunately Heroku does not offer the option for free tier. I'll have to make do with a dictionary instead. 

> Still working on some minor improvements, such as creating a new worksheet whenever it's a new month for simpler tracking purposes, and deleting older worksheets every few months as well. Looking into this mby using Google Apps Script, or maybe a cron-job executing a python file every month. Still rather unsure of the process.

> Apologies in advance for the spaghetti code ðŸ˜¬, do feel free to clone this repository and make your own edits and improvements to it. Thank you!
